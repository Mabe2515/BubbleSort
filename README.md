# Description

* This bubble sort program is designed to sort 8 numbers that range from 0-100 by comparing 2 numbers at a time and swapping them if one is a higher value than the other.

* Example is (4123)>(1423)>(1243)>(1234)

# How to Use

* The user will be asked to input 8 values ranging from 0-100 in a 3-digit format for sorting. The program will sort the numbers from the lowest value to the highest value and outputs them to the console in ascending order.
